* Any regular expression syntax can be used here (without the delimiters).
* Regular expressions are always case insensitive.
* No regular expression may span more than one line.
* Anything after the '#' character until the end of a line is ignored, so use this for comments.
* If you only want to write out keywords, remember to escape special characters that have meaning in regex.
