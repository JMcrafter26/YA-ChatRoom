# Important

Do NOT use this yet. It's not ready for use. 

**If you use it, you need to set the folder permissions right, to prevent unauthorized access to the files.**

<!-- 
Set the folder permissions of `asstest/inc/` to `770` (No read, write, execute for others) so its contents are not accessible from the web.

**BUT** make sure that the rest `asstest/` folder is still accessible to the web server. -->
